# Ambassador Program

## Overview

The Ambassador Program is designed for passionate community members who want to help grow the Intento ecosystem. As an ambassador, you'll play a crucial role in spreading awareness, educating others, and contributing to the success of the platform.

By joining, you become a key part of Intento’s mission to make on-chain workflows accessible, impactful, and community-driven.

## Token Allocation

To ensure long-term alignment and rewards for our ambassadors, **2% (8 MIL) of the total INTO token supply** will be allocated to the Ambassador Program. This pool will be used to reward contributions, incentivize growth, and recognize top-performing ambassadors over time.

We’ll distribute 3M over the first 3 years to reward early contributions, with the remaining 5M held in reserve to support future growth, to ensure continued ambassador engagement, and to reward top-performing ambassadors.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Ambassadors can participate in a variety of activities, including:

- **Community Engagement:** Assist new members, moderate discussions, and answer questions on X (Twitter), Discord, and other platforms.

- **Content Creation:** Produce tutorials, blog posts, videos, and memes that highlight Intento’s products and ecosystem.

- **Events & Campaigns:** Host or participate in webinars, workshops, or online/offline events promoting Intento.

- **Feedback & Testing:** Provide insights on new features, beta tools, and integrations to help improve the platform.

### **Quality Rating System**

To make content rewards fairer, each submission can be **rated on 4 dimensions (1–5 scale)**:

### **1\. Relevance & Reach**

How well the content connects with the audience and how many people it successfully reaches.

### **2\. Quality & Clarity**

The excellence and trustworthiness of the content, combined with how easy it is to understand.

### **3\. Engagement & Social Media Activeness**

How you interact with our content and the consistency of your presence on our social media and the quality of engagement with the content you post.

### **4\. Creativity & Effort**

The originality of the ideas and the amount of work invested in bringing them to life.

### **Reward Calculation**

Each dimension is rated on a scale of **1–5**.  
Your **final score** is the **average rating across all four dimensions**, expressed as a percentage:

**Reward Score = (Average Rating ÷ 5) × 100**

This score determines your share of the available rewards for that period.
