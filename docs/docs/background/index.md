Intento is a decentralized system built with the Cosmos SDK for intent-based execution via flows, enabling orchestration across IBC-connected chains without smart contracts. TRST Labs has been developing the Intent module since early 2023 to abstract transaction complexity and enable permissionless, self-custodial orchestration.  

### Why Cosmos?  

The Cosmos ecosystem is a network of application-specific blockchains connected by IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication). Intento aligns with Cosmos’s vision of a modular and interoperable blockchain future, enabling secure, cross-chain applications for all. Intento is proud to be part of this decentralized community building key decentralized infrastructure for a more interconnected tomorrow.

### Our Mission

Intento eliminates the need for intermediary smart contracts, allowing users to orchestrate blockchain actions directly through simple configurations. Our goal is to:  

1. **Put users in control** – Self-custodial execution without reliance on third parties.  
2. **Improve efficiency** – Reduce gas costs and simplify multi-chain interactions.  
3. **Expand accessibility** – Enable new financial workflows with low-friction orchestration.  
4. **Enhance security** – Remove privileged execution layers and centralized points of failure.  

### IBC – A New Standard for Cross-Chain Execution  

Unlike traditional bridges, IBC provides direct chain-to-chain communication without external validators. Intento leverages IBC, ICA (Interchain Accounts), and ICQ (Interchain Queries) to enable new use cases. By combining intent-based execution with Cosmos’s modular and scalable architecture, Intento sets a new standard for blockchain orchestration.
