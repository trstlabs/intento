Intento is distributed and decentralized system built with the Cosmos SDK for submitting and executing intent-based actions. TRST Labs's extensive `Intent` Cosmos SDK module, developed using the Cosmos SDK, has been under development since early 2023. The module abstracts transaction complexities and offers chain-agnostic and interdependent orchestration of actions. By simplifying asset control and enabling permissionless automation of actions on connected IBC chains, this module moves value across protocols.

## Cosmos

The Cosmos ecosystem is a decentralized network designed to connect various blockchains as part of the 'Internet of blockchains' vision. A vast, interconnected system of blockchains, each specifically designed to serve a particular use case. Intento is proud to be part of this decentralized community building key decentralized infrastructure for a more interconnected tomorrow.

## Our Goals

Our vision is to enable anyone to integrate blockchain operations in a truly seamless manner; that is, without the need for intermediary or custom smart contracts. Our intent-centric automation module aims to enable workflows where the user is in control, abstracts away transactions, enhances liquidity and accessibility, and provides novel use cases. By achieving these goals, we can revolutionize transactions, empowering users with greater control and efficiency while fostering a vibrant and differentiated ecosystem.

## IBC - Inter-Blockchain Communication

IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating all kinds of data between arbitrary state machines.
It is different than other bridges as enables direct chain to chain communication. Hence, it is often referred to as a trustless bridging solution.
The IBC application layer can be used to build a wide range of cross-chain applications, including but not limited to token transfers, passing messages between accounts on two chains, NFT transfers and oracle data feeds.

With Intento you can automate smart contracts easily over IBC.
