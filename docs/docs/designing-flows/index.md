- **Wallet Providers:** Enable auto-compounding for staking rewards with conditional execution (e.g., MetaMask, Keplr, Leap).
- **Recurring Payments:** Facilitate scheduled transactions across blockchains.
- **Governance Automations:** Ensure proposals and votes happen at the right moment.
- **Portfolio Management:** Optimize asset distribution across chains effortlessly.
