# The INTO Token ($INTO)

$INTO is the native token of the Intento Network — a Cosmos-based L1 designed to orchestrate complex, self-custodial execution flows across the interchain.

Its role is deliberately narrow and structural: securing the network, coordinating economic incentives, governing protocol evolution, and pricing execution of intent-based flows. $INTO is not positioned as a speculative asset, but as a coordination primitive embedded directly into how Intento operates.

## Why $INTO Exists

An intent-based L1 requires more than generic gas mechanics. Intento needs a token that can simultaneously:

* Secure the chain via Proof-of-Stake
* Govern execution rules, upgrades, and treasury usage
* Incentivize validators, relayers, and builders
* Price and regulate cross-chain execution flows

$INTO fulfills these requirements as a single coordination asset.

By staking $INTO, participants:

* Contribute to network security
* Earn staking rewards and fee-based incentives
* Participate directly in governance
* Benefit from protocol usage via fee capture and burn mechanics


## Network Utility and Fee Model

Execution on Intento is expressed through programmable flows composed of on-chain messages. Fees scale with complexity: simple flows cost less, multi-step interchain flows cost more.

Key characteristics:

* **Gas-based pricing:** Fees are charged per message and execution step
* **Conditional logic is free:** Queries and condition checks (balances, prices, rewards) do not incur fees
* **Multi-token fees:** Fees can be paid in $INTO or supported foreign assets (e.g. ATOM, OSMO)

### Fee Routing

* **Fees paid in $INTO:**

  * A portion is burned per message
  * The remainder is distributed to stakers

* **Fees paid in other tokens:**

  * Routed entirely to the Community Pool

This creates two parallel value paths: deflationary pressure on $INTO through usage, and steady treasury growth in diversified assets.

### Wallet Fallback

Flows can draw fees directly from a user’s wallet balance without requiring upfront deposits. Users sign once and retain custody throughout execution.

## Staking, Security, and Governance

$INTO secures the Intento chain via Proof-of-Stake.

* Validators and delegators stake $INTO
* Stakers earn inflation rewards and a share of execution fees
* Governance power is proportional to stake

Governance controls:

* Network parameters (fees, burn rates, execution limits)
* Allowed message types and flow features
* Community Pool allocations
* Software upgrades and integrations

Governance authority is intentionally broad, reflecting Intento’s role as shared coordination infrastructure.

## Token Supply and Allocation

Genesis supply: **400,000,000 INTO**

The allocation is structured to balance early participation, long-term alignment, and operational flexibility.

| Category          | Amount (M) | % of Supply | Vesting                        |
| ----------------- | ---------: | ----------: | ------------------------------ |
| Airdrop           |         90 |       22.5% | Action-based, short-term       |
| Team              |         90 |       22.5% | 5-year continuous vesting      |
| Community Pool    |         82 |       20.5% | DAO-controlled                 |
| Strategic Reserve |         70 |       17.5% | 50% liquid, 50% 5-year vesting |
| StreamSwap Event  |         40 |       10.0% | Liquid                         |
| Grant Program     |         22 |        5.5% | 5-year continuous vesting      |
| Testnet Program   |          6 |        1.5% | Liquid                         |
| **Total**         |    **400** |    **100%** |                                |

### Vesting Principles

* No cliffs across major allocations
* Continuous vesting aligned with long-term contribution
* Meaningful circulating supply at launch

This structure avoids abrupt supply shocks while maintaining sufficient liquidity for network usage.

## Emissions and Inflation

$INTO follows a decaying inflation schedule designed to bootstrap security without permanent dilution.

* Initial inflation: **10% annually**
* Annual decay: **25% reduction year-over-year**
* Near-zero inflation (<1%) by Year 10
* Long-term supply projection: ~559M after 20 years (excluding burns)

| Year    | Estimated Supply | Inflation |
| ------- | ---------------: | --------: |
| Genesis |             400M |         – |
| Year 1  |             440M |     10.0% |
| Year 3  |             470M |      6.8% |
| Year 5  |             509M |      3.4% |
| Year 10 |             548M |      0.7% |
| Year 20 |             559M |     ~0.0% |

Emissions are governed and can evolve as network needs change.



## Airdrop Outcome and Clawback

The airdrop was designed to prioritize active participation rather than passive claims. Unclaimed allocations were returned to the Community Pool.

**Result:**

* **77M $INTO** clawed back
* Added directly to the Community Pool

This materially increased DAO-controlled resources and reduced inactive supply, strengthening long-term alignment.



## Community Pool

The Community Pool functions as the protocol treasury.

Funds may be allocated via governance for:

* Builder grants and ecosystem development
* Liquidity initiatives
* Relayer and infrastructure incentives
* Strategic buybacks or burns

Treasury assets include both $INTO and foreign fee tokens accrued through network usage.



## Summary

$INTO is the coordination asset underlying Intento’s execution layer.

It is used to:

* Secure the network
* Govern protocol evolution
* Price and regulate execution
* Align incentives across validators, relayers, builders, and users

As usage increases, execution fees grow, supply is reduced through burns, and the Community Pool expands. The system is designed to scale with real activity, not speculation.

$INTO’s value is inseparable from Intento’s role as interchain coordination infrastructure.
