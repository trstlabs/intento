## What is Intento?

Intento is a decentralized execution layer for **intent-based flows**.  
It lets users and applications describe *what should happen*—across chains, over time, or based on conditions—and have that intent executed permissionlessly and self-custodially.

No custom smart contracts.  
No privileged executors.  
No trusted relayers.

Just declarative intent → verifiable execution.

The Intento engine is developed by TRST Labs since early 2023 with one goal: **abstract transaction complexity without abstracting control**.


## How Intento Works (High Level)

Intento introduces *flows*: structured execution plans that define:

- **Actions** (transactions, cross-chain calls, swaps, transfers)
- **Conditions** (time, state, feedback loops, comparisons)
- **Execution scope** (single-chain or multi-chain)
- **Ownership** (always user-controlled)

Flows are submitted once and executed autonomously according to their configuration—without requiring upgradeable contracts or delegated custody.


## Chain Support: Cosmos, EVM, and Beyond

Intento is **chain-agnostic by design**.

Today, Intento is deployed on a Cosmos SDK chain and leverages native cross-chain primitives to coordinate execution across multiple networks. This provides battle-tested guarantees around message passing, account control, and verification.

At the same time, Intento is built to **orchestrate across ecosystems**, including:

- **Cosmos chains** (via native cross-chain accounts and queries)
- **EVM chains** (via external execution targets and message routing)
- **Hybrid flows** that span Cosmos ↔ EVM environments

Cosmos is not the product—it’s the execution substrate.  
The intent model, flow engine, and orchestration logic are portable.


## Why Intent-Based Execution?

Most blockchain UX still forces users to think in **transactions**:
sign this, submit that, wait, repeat.

Intento flips that model:

- Users express **desired outcomes**
- The system handles **ordering, retries, timing, and coordination**
- Execution remains **fully transparent and verifiable**

This enables workflows that are otherwise painful or impossible:
- Streaming and recurring actions
- Cross-chain strategies
- Conditional execution without on-chain bots
- Long-lived automation without smart contract risk


## Core Principles

1. **User Control First**  
   Execution is always self-custodial. No hidden permissions, no opaque agents.

2. **No Custom Smart Contracts**  
   Flows operate using existing chain capabilities—reducing attack surface and governance risk.

3. **Composable by Default**  
   Flows can trigger other flows, react to chain state, or integrate external systems.

4. **Minimal Trust, Maximum Verifiability**  
   Every step is observable, deterministic, and auditable.


## Under the Hood (Briefly)

Depending on the target chain, Intento uses:
- Cross-chain accounts for remote execution
- State queries for conditional logic
- Deterministic message routing for multi-step flows

These components allow Intento to coordinate actions across chains without introducing new trust assumptions.

You don’t need to understand the internals to use Intento—but they’re there when you want to go deeper.


## Next Steps

- Learn how flows are structured  
- Explore example intent configurations  
- Deploy your first cross-chain flow  

Intento is not another abstraction layer.  
It’s an execution primitive for how blockchain interactions should work going forward.
