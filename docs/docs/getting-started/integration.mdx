description: Empower your users with smart flows that enhance security, efficiency, and flexibility

Imagine a world where your blockchain actions are seamless, automated, and entirely under your control. No more manual rebalancing, forgotten governance votes, or missed staking rewards. Whether you’re managing liquidity on a DEX, automating wallet functions, or streamlining governance processes, you need a system that works for you—without constant oversight.

This guide is for integrators who want to leverage interchain execution to bring efficiency and innovation to their users.
By designing smart execution flows, you empower your users with flows that enhance security, efficiency, and flexibility while keeping them in control.

Flows can be created either directly on the Intento chain or through an IBC transfer channel with flow submission details in the memo.

#### Message Types

Understanding message types is crucial for designing effective execution flows:

- **Local Messages:** Messages sent directly by users on the Intento chain, this includes MsgTransfer, which can perform actions like swaps on selected chains through an IBC transfer channel. With packet forwarding 50+ chains are supported. 
- **Authz MsgExec Messages:** Enables one account to execute messages on behalf of another.
- **ICA (Interchain Accounts) Messages:** Messages sent via IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) through an interchain account.

##### Trustless Agents vs Self-Hosted Interchain Accounts

Both are trust-minimized solutions, but they have different use cases. Trustless Agents are uncontrollable interchain accounts that abstract away fees while keeping user flows fully self-custodial.
Self-hosted Interchain Accounts are controllable interchain accounts by the creator.

- **Trustless Agents** are only allowed to call `MsgExec` so they can execute actions on behalf of the flow submitter (typically end users) when they have an active grant via `MsgGrant` of the Authz Cosmos SDK module on the host chain.
- **Self-Hosted Interchain Accounts** provide full execution control, which can be useful for high-level protocol actions.

#### Using Conditions in Flows

Conditions help define execution logic and handle different scenarios:

- **Stoplights:** Stop execution on failure to prevent unwanted state changes.
- **Comparisons:** Execute actions based on specific conditions or thresholds.
- **Feedback Loops:** Continuously adapt execution based on prior results.
- **Interchain Queries (ICQ):** Query a blockchain's state to make informed execution decisions.
