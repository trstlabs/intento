description: Empower your users with smart flows that enhance security, efficiency, and flexibility
---

Imagine a world where your blockchain actions are seamless, automated, and entirely under your control. No more manual rebalancing, forgotten governance votes, or missed staking rewards. Whether you’re managing liquidity on a DEX, automating wallet functions, or streamlining governance processes, you need a system that works for you—without constant oversight.

This guide is for integrators who want to leverage interchain execution to bring efficiency and innovation to their users.
By designing smart execution flows, you empower your users with flows that enhance security, efficiency, and flexibility while keeping them in control.

Flows can be created either directly on the Intento chain or through an IBC transfer channel with flow submission details in the memo.

#### Message Types

Understanding message types is crucial for designing effective execution flows:

- **Local Messages:** Messages sent directly by users on the Intento chain, this includes `MsgTransfer` for cross-chain swaps and transfers (Packet Forwarding supported for 50+ chains).
- **Proxy Account Messages:** Messages executed on another chain via a Proxy Account (ICA or Union Proxy).
- **Trustless Agent Messages:** Enables one account (like a Trustless Agent) to execute messages on behalf of another.

##### Trustless Agents vs. Self-Hosted Proxy Accounts

There are two main ways to execute cross-chain actions:

1.  **Trustless Agents**
    *   **Best for:** Ease of use, gas abstraction.
    *   **How it works:** An agent (third-party) executes actions on your behalf. You grant them permission (via AuthZ) to execute specific messages. The agent pays the gas fees.
    *   **Security:** Trust-minimized. Agents can only execute what you explicitly authorize.

2.  **Self-Hosted Proxy Accounts**
    *   **Best for:** Full control, power users, protocols.
    *   **How it works:** You control the account directly.
        *   **Rest of Interchain (Cosmos):** You register an **ICA**. You must fund the ICA address on the host chain to pay for gas.
        *   **EVM (via Union):** You use your **Union Proxy Account**. This address is **inferred** (deterministic) and requires no registration. You authorize it via **Permits/Approvals** on the EVM chain. You must ensure the proxy has access to gas or assets as needed.

#### Using Conditions in Flows

Conditions help define execution logic and handle different scenarios:

- **Stoplights:** Stop execution on failure to prevent unwanted state changes.
- **Comparisons:** Execute actions based on specific conditions or thresholds.
- **Feedback Loops:** Continuously adapt execution based on prior results.
- **Interchain Queries (ICQ):** Query a blockchain's state to make informed execution decisions.
