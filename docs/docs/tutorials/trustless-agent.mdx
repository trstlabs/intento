Integrators can leverage one of the Trustless Agents that are available on [Intento](https://api-mainnet.intento.zone/intento/intent/v1/trustless-agents), or run their own.
Trustless Agents improve UX and reduce gas costs for users, while also providing a way to monitize an Intento integration by a third party. 
On default, no fee is paid to the Trustless Agent, but it can be configured to earn INTO / ATOM rewards or any token. Flow submitters must set a fee limit and add your Trustless Agent explicitly in order to activate fee payment.

**Trustless Agents** allow anyone to **execute flows** on behalf of users. Trustless Agents always execute via **authz** and always route through proper authentication in the intent engine to ensure users stay in full control of their assets in the most secure way.

### Prerequisites
- [intentod](https://github.com/trstlabs/intento) installed. Check [here](https://github.com/trstlabs/intento/releases) for latest version.
### Why Run a Trustless Agent?

- You are running a relayer or incentivizing relayers and want to **cover gas fees that are paid by the relayers**
- You can **earn token rewards** and monitize your integration

### Quick Start

#### 1. Create a Trustless Agent

```bash
intentod tx intent create-trustless-agent \
  --connection-id connection-INTO-TO-OSMO \
  --fee-coins-suported "1uinto,10ibc/F1B5C3489F881CC56ECC12EA903EFCF5D200B4D8123852C191A88A31AC79A8E4" \
  --from your-into-addr
  --node https://rpc-mainnet.intento.zone
```

- `--connection-id`: the **Intento** IBC connection ID (e.g., to OSMO)
- `--fee-coins-suported`: Coins supported as fees for Trustless Agent

Fee coins supported are an amount per execution and a denom. An execution is a transaction that is submitted to the host chain by the relayer. This can contain one or several messages.

#### 2. Update or Rotate Fee Admin

If you need another ICA address or want to change the fee admin:

```bash
intentod tx intent update-trustless-agent \
  --connection-id connection-INTO-TO-OSMO \
  --trustless-agent into1hostedaccount \
  --new-admin your-new-into-admin-addr \
  --from your-into-admin-addr
  --node https://rpc-mainnet.intento.zone
```

- `--fee-coins-suported`: Coins supported as fees for Trustless Agent, optional here
- `--trustless-agent`: the address created on Intento via create-trustless-agent.
- You can retrieve this from the swagger docs: https://lcd.intento.zone/swagger/#get-/intento/intent/v1/trustless-agents/-admin-

### üîê Security & Permissions

- Trustless Agents **never get access to user funds**.
- Our [authentication module](../reference/intent-engine/authentication) enforces that:
  - All flow actions must originate from the flow **owner‚Äôs wallet**.
  - You must have an **authz grant** for any MsgExec submitted.

In other words: users **retain full control** over their funds, and Trustless Agents are only permitted to submit on their behalf if granted through the AuthZ module on the host chain.
