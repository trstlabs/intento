Intento Portal is a user interface designed for developers, DeFi power users and integrators. With Intento Portal you can submit, view, manage, and update powerfull Intento flows using conditions, comparisons, and feedback loops.

### Use Cases

- **Automation of Token Transfers and Swaps**  
  Define recurring token transfers with custom conditions to multiple recipients. Useful for strategies, reducing slippage on large trades, and streaming payments.

- **Advanced On-Chain Conditions**  
  Build flows with feedback loops, comparisons, and time intervals that react to real-time on-chain state. For example, conditional autocompound flows that cash out when prices are high, or trading strategies that compares a moving average with the current price.

- **Cross-Chain Interoperability**  
  Execute workflows across multiple chains using Trustless Agent. These are ICA addresses on Intento that subsidize fees.

### Key Features

- **Flow Builder**. Build and submit flows
- **Flow Management**. View, update, and delete flows
- **Flow Monitoring**. View execution history, status, and results
- **Flow Notifications**. Receive notifications when flows are created, executed, updated or timeout.
- **Copy and Create**. Copy and create flows for reuse
- **Custom Submit Page**. Integrators and AI Agents can dynamically let users submit flows in an easy and secure way

## Build Flows

### 1. Choose Chain and Execution Account

Go to the `Flow Builder`. First, choose the target chain for execution.

### 2. Build Messages

Add messages that define what you want to execute. Intent Templates are available for the supported chains, these can also include conditions and feedback loops so you don't have to worry about the configuration. For Osmosis, you’ll find both contract interaction templates and DEX-related messages.

### 3. Conditional Logic (Optional)

Flows can include conditional logic to control execution based on comparisons, external queries, or feedback loops.

**Execution behavior**

- By default, execution continues if _any_ comparison evaluates to `true`.
- The configuration can be set to `AND` mode, requiring _all_ comparisons to evaluate to `true`.

**Use cases**

- Balance checks
- Output comparisons
- Detecting state changes
- Asset price checks
- Reinvesting rewards or similar actions

**Available Condition items**

- **Comparisons**: Define logical checks, e.g. `price > 100`.

- **Feedback Loops**: Re-run actions automatically, e.g. autocompounding.
![3.2](@site/docs/images/portal/build/3.2.png)
- **Interchain Queries**: Query state or prices from other chains; used inside comparisons or feedback loops. You can generate state keys for types like balances, smart contract state, delegations, price records and test them using the `/cosmos/base/tendermint/v1beta1/abci_query` endpoint the target chain.
![3.3](@site/docs/images/portal/build/3.3.png)
- **Stoplights**: Configure stop/skip behavior on fail, success, or timeout. Stoplights can also link flows together, enabling complex workflows.
![3.4](@site/docs/images/portal/build/3.4.png)

Next to the templates, you can find flow examples and reusable condition snippets in the [Intento Portal Dashboard](https://portal.intento.zone) or in the [ integration hub repository](https://github.com/trstlabs/intento-integration-hub)


### 4. Configure Execution Settings

Decide how execution should behave:

- Retry until success
- Stop after an error or timeout
- Enable wallet fallback (fees are taken from your main wallet if flow account does not hold (enough) funds). Will use INTO first to save fees.

### 5. Final Flow Settings

When you're ready, hit `Build Flow`. In the dialog:

- **Set start time** _(optional)_: when the first run begins
- **Set interval**: how often it should run
- **Set end time**: when the flow should end. You can use the calendar to select a date and time or the quick selector to select a duration.

> Not selecting a start time means the first interval (e.g., 1 hour) will be used as the initial delay.

You’ll also configure fee settings:

- Deduct from wallet (requires fallback wallet). In Intento Portal, this is enabled by default.
- Attach fee account to the flow (optional). _(Unused fees are refunded after the final execution.)_

![dialogfullscreen](@site/docs/images/portal/build/dialogfullscreen.png)

The `Overview` section summarizes:

- Number of executions
- Start/end time
- Optional label for identifying the flow later

Click `Submit` to broadcast the flow. A notification will link to the dashboard view.

## Authorization

Flows using Trustless Agents require `AuthZ` (authorization) from your wallet.

In Cosmos, every message has:

- a `typeUrl` (e.g., `/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend`)
- and `value` fields (payload)

You grant `AuthZ` to a Trustless Agent using `MsgGrant` for specific message types and expiration (defaults to your flow's end time + 1 day on Intento Portal). The Trustless Agent can then use `MsgExec` to execute those messages.

**Security**: AuthZ for Intento Flows is scoped. Trustless Agents can **only** execute flows with messages submitted by the flow owner.

:::info
It’s recommended to use small amounts of tokens or a short duration initially to test it out first, especially on mainnet. You can always update your messages and increase amounts later.

## Notes on Message Format

- Use **camelCase** in message fields (e.g., `fromAddress` not `from_address`)
- Token values are supported both in **base units** and **denom**:
  - `5 ATOM` = `5000000uatom`
  - `5 INTO` = `5000000uinto`
  - `0.5 INTO` = `500000uinto`

For IBC tokens, the units are always in the base format + `ibc/{hash}`.

## Placeholders

You can use the Your Address placeholder as is, it will be replaced with the user's address when the flow is submitted.
For on Intento you can use the Your Intento Address, it will be replaced with the user's Intento address when the flow is submitted.

For other prefixes you can use the placeholder `Your {prefix} Address` e.g. `Your osmo Address`.
