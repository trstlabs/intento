title: Integrating Interchain Queries
description: Interchain Queries for conditions in Intent-Based Flows
---

The **Interchain Query (ICQ) feature** enables seamless cross-chain interactions by querying the state of one blockchain from another. This feature allows developers to create intent-based actions that trigger specific behaviors based on the queried data. By utilizing interchain queries, you can automate decision-making processes across multiple blockchains, providing an efficient way to orchestrate complex, multi-chain applications.

### How It Works

Interchain queries allow you to access the key-value store of a different blockchain by providing a specific key to query. IBC relayers submit query responses. This queried state can then be used to determine what actions should be triggered, based on predefined conditions. For instance, you can check the balance of a particular account on one blockchain and then execute a corresponding action on another chain, such as staking, transferring, or adjusting governance proposals.

### Supported Types and Proto Interfaces

You can query various data types from the state of other chains. There are two primary methods to accomplish this:

1. **Supported Types:** You can use one of the [supported types](./../module/supported_types.md), which are predefined and commonly used data types within the Cosmos ecosystem.
2. **Registered Proto Interfaces:** Alternatively, you can utilize the registered protocol buffer interfaces that adhere to Cosmos SDK standards. These provide a more flexible way to query and interpret the state, allowing you to work with complex data structures.

### Feedback Loops and Comparisons

Once the queried data is retrieved, it can be used for [**comparisons**](./conditions.md#comparison-operators) or to establish [**feedback loops**](./conditions.md#feedback-loops). For example, if a queried balance exceeds a certain threshold, you can trigger an action to stake the excess funds. Likewise, if a validatorâ€™s status on one chain changes, you can automatically adjust delegations or governance votes on another chain.

This capability unlocks numerous possibilities for cross-chain workflows, simplifying multi-chain dApp logic and empowering developers to build more dynamic and responsive applications in the interchain ecosystem.

## Integrating ICQs

You can use the ICQ feature by attaching an `ICQConfig` into [**comparisons**](./conditions.md#comparisons) and [**feedback loops**](./conditions.md#feedback-loops). In the `ICQConfig`, you specify what to query, where to query it, and how to handle a timeout scenario.

| Field              | Type                                       | Description                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connection_id`    | `string`                                   | The ID of the connection to use for the interchain query.                                 |
| `chain_id`         | `string`                                   | The ID of the blockchain to query.                                                        |
| `timeout_policy`   | `intento.interchainquery.v1.TimeoutPolicy` | The policy to apply when a timeout occurs.                                                |
| `timeout_duration` | `google.protobuf.Duration`                 | The duration to wait before a timeout is triggered.                                       |
| `query_type`       | `string`                                   | The type of query to perform (e.g., `store/bank/key`, `store/staking/key`).               |
| `query_key`        | `string`                                   | The key in the store to query (e.g., `stakingtypes.GetValidatorKey(validatorAddressBz)`). |

For example, the `query_type` can be `store/bank/key` or `store/staking/key`. The `query_key` is the key in the store to query, such as `stakingtypes.GetValidatorKey(validatorAddressBz)`. These queries are abstracted in the TriggerPortal frontend, and examples can be found in `x/interchainquery/types/keys.go`.

```proto
// Config for using interchain queries
message ICQConfig {
  string connection_id = 1;
  string chain_id = 2;
  intento.interchainquery.v1.TimeoutPolicy timeout_policy = 3;
  google.protobuf.Duration timeout_duration = 4 [
    (gogoproto.nullable) = false,
    (gogoproto.stdduration) = true
  ];
  string query_type = 5;
  string query_key = 6;
}
```

If SaveResponses in the Flow Configuration is set to true, query responses are added to the Flow History. Check out the [**Supported Types**](./../module/supported_types.md) page or the TriggerPortal Flow Builder for some example queries.

## x/interchainqueries

SubmitQueryResponse is used to return the query responses. It is used by IBC Relayers.

```protobuf
message MsgSubmitQueryResponse {
  string chain_id = 1;
  string query_id = 2;
  bytes result = 3;
  tendermint.crypto.ProofOps proof_ops = 4;
  int64 height = 5;
  string from_address = 6;
}
```

Query PendingQueries lists all queries that have been requested (i.e. emitted but have not had a response submitted yet)

```protobuf
message QueryPendingQueriesRequest {}
```
