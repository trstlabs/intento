### Installing the Intento deamon

Download `intentod` from [the main repo](https://github.com/trstlabs/intento) with `wget https://github.com/trstlabs/intento.git` and perform `make deb` to build a binary. Then install the binary with `sudo apt install ./Intento_VERSION_amd64.deb -y`. Test if it is installed correctly by running `intentod`.

You can configure the RPC endpoint with `intentod config node https://endpoint:port` or start the chain locally by running the `./inittest.sh` script.

## Local Flow execution

You can submit local flows using the following format:

```bash

intentod tx intent submit-flow  '{
    "@type":"/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
    "amount": [{
        "amount": "70",
        "denom": "uinto"
    }],
    "from_address": "into12gxmzpucje8aflw2vz45rv8x4nyaaj3rp8vjh03dulehkdl5fu6s93ewkp",
    "to_address": "into1ykql5ktedxkpjszj5trzu8f5dxajvgv95nuwjx"
}' --duration 16h --interval 60s --keyring-backend test -y --from b --fees 600uinto
```

Fees are denominated in `uinto`. Similar to other Cosmos chains, it is a 6-decimal denomination of `INTO`.
`intentod tx intent submit-flow` takes one argument, a JSON-encoded Cosmos message. `@type` can be retrieved from the destination chain's `/proto` directory.
For parsing a message to automate with the CLI, use snake case. `fromAddress` will be `from_address`.
:::info the Cosmos message type should be a registered type on Intento
:::

This "type url" is based of the proto package name, in this example it is `cosmos.bank.v1beta1` and the name of the message is `MsgSend`. TRST Labs has registerd types of CosmWasm types and the Osmosis types. Any message should be registered before it can be encoded correctly on Intento.

`--duration` and `--interval` flags must contain either `s`,`m`or `h`, which stand for seconds, minutes and hours. It can be a combination of all of these. Like so: `48h30m30s`.
`--start_at` can be specified to create a custom start time for the first execution. It is in nanoseconds since UNIX epoch such as `1678199141`.

When an flow should execute once, `duration` will be the time between now and the execution time.
If the flow is recurring, `duration` will be the time execution will be unavailable.

## With Interchain Accounts (ICA)

The message will be similar to the above.
You can choose a self-hosted ICA or a hosted ICA that takes care of the fees for you. Learn about the difference [here].
For both accounts a _connection_id_ flag should be specified. You can find all available connections with `intentod q ibc connection connections`.
For a hosted account the `--hosted-account` and the `--hosted-account-fee-limit` flags should be specified. See examples below. You can find all available host accounts with `intentod q intent list-host-accounts`.

### What is a connection and how does it differ from a channel?

A connection is the direct link between two chains, while a channel is a specific path within that connection that enables communication between two specific modules on different chains. Using a connection, multiple channels can be created. Both connections and channels are usually different for on source chain and on the destination chain.

Channels have ports such as `icacontroller-into1...` or `transfer`. By using a connection, Intento creates an IBC port ID for your address and the destination chain.

This source port is denoted as `icacontroller-into1...`. For an Interchain Account host, the destination port is `host`.
A connection is needed to create the channels and ports.

### Register Self-Hosted ICA and Submit Flow

When you submit an flow for the first time using a self-hosted Interchain Accounts, you can perform `register-ica-and-submit-flow` instead of `submit-flow`.

Alternatively you can first perform `intentod tx intent register` and specify the `--connection-id` fla and later submit the flow.

You can submit an flow with the following command:

```bash
intentod tx intent submit-flow  '{
    "@type":"/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
    "amount": [{
        "amount": "70",
        "denom": "uinto"
    }],
    "from_address": "ICA_ADDR",
    "to_address": "into1ykql5ktedxkpjszj5trzu8f5dxajvgv95nuwjx"
}' --duration 16h --interval 60s --keyring-backend test -y --from b --fees 600uinto --connection-id connection-0 --retries 2
```

:::tip use ICA_ADDR as a `from_address` or any other field in an flow and Intento will parse the to-be defined Interchain Account Address.
:::

```bash
# query the flows to see if it worked. After a time-based execution the flow history should update
intentod query intent list-flows-by-owner $WALLET_1
```

You can get the Interchain Account address with the following command:

```bash
export ICA_ADDR=$(intentod q intent interchainaccounts $WALLET_1 connection-0 -o json | jq -r '.interchain_account_address') && echo $ICA_ADDR
```

:::tip to get more info you can query the events related to the packet for packet and message info `intentod q interchain-accounts host packet-events channel-0 1 --node tcp://localhost:36657`
:::

## With AuthZ

This flow is similar to interchain acccounts. For AuthZ, you first create a grant on the host chain. In the messages below, the grantee is the interchain account address associated with the flow. This can be a self-hosted or a hosted ICA.

For this we use another local Intento chain. On a host chain you can create a grant with a command like the following:

```bash
intentod tx authz grant $ICA_ADDR generic --msg-type /cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgDelegate --keyring-backend test -y --from b --fees 600uinto  --node tcp://localhost:36657  --chain-id intentodev-2
```

Hereafter, on Intento you can execute the message with the ICA as the grantee and the Msgs array in the MsgExec should include the `--msg-type` from before.

```bash
intentod tx intent submit-flow  '{
    "@type":"/cosmos.authz.v1beta1.MsgExec",
    "msgs": [{
    "@type": "/cosmos.staking.v1beta1.MsgDelegate",
    "amount": {
        "amount": "70",
        "denom": "uinto"
    },
    "delegator_address": "into1ykql5ktedxkpjszj5trzu8f5dxajvgv95nuwjx",
    "validator_address": "trustvaloper1q6k0w4cejawpkzxgqhvs4m2v6uvdzm6jhmz5jy"
}],
    "grantee": "ICA_ADDR"
}' --duration 4h --interval 60s --keyring-backend test -y --from b --fees 600uinto --connection-id connection-0
```

## Configuration
